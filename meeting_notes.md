would cut systems work, simplicity is a selling point

Question (think about it, maybe ask Michael Bender):
  submit to SOSA or ALENEX21?

# cup game
fix the problem with it

ITCS sept 1 deadline

# serial or parallel
intro: no preemption = very exciting!

next directions

- recursion maybe
- fixed number of processors (split evenly)
- efficient offline batch algorithm

notes: 
- motivation Cilk program
- maybe average response time is a cooler metric
- talk to Michael Bender about what to do
- yo randomized lower bound whp should work out (repeat
    construction, chernoff bound => works)
- making the offline batch alg fast
  - bin packing
  - greed
  - DP
