\section{An Algorithm for Optimizing Response Time}
\label{sec:responsetime}

In this section we construct an algorithm that achieves low
response time. As shown in Section~\ref{sec:lowerbounds}, our
algorithm necessarily uses preemption.
We propose Algorithm~\ref{alg:pr}, which we call $\PR{\alpha}$
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{$\PR{\alpha}$}
  \label{alg:pr}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \While{True}
      \State OPT-schedule $\gets$ how OPT would schedule tasks if
      all tasks were preempted and no more tasks come.
      \State projected-schedule $\gets$ what if we just wait
      \If{OPT-schedule response time $\le \alpha \cdot$ projected response time}
        \State Run OPT-schedule
      \EndIf
    \EndWhile
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
