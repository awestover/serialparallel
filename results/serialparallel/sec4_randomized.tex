\section{Randomized Scheduling Algorithms}
Given a particular deterministic scheduling algorithm there will
be some inputs on which the algorithm will perform poorly. 
By employing randomization these worst case inputs can be
mitigated somewhat, at least in expectation.

We propose Algorithm~\ref{alg:rgr}, which we call
\defn{RGR} (RGR stands for \enquote{randomized greedy}), for this case.

\todo{this alg is outdated}
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{RGR}
  \label{alg:rgr}
  \begin{algorithmic}
    \While{True}
      \If{verge time}
        \State sleep for a random amount of time, chosen
        uniformly at random from something, not really sure what 
        \State $q \gets $ number of ready tasks
        \If{$q \ge p/k$}
          \State schedule $\min(q, p)$ tasks in serial
          \State giving each processor at most $1$ task
        \Else
          \State schedule one task in parallel
          \State distributing its work equally 
        \EndIf
      \EndIf
    \EndWhile
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{proposition}
  The expectation of RGR's competitive ratio on any input
  is at least $1.5$.
\end{proposition}
